This article is about the overall concept of games called football. For the balls themselves, see Football . For specific versions of the game and other uses of the term, see Football.
Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries) gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football) Australian rules football rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league) and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

A football is an oval-like inflated ball usually made of cowhide or rubber. The offense, or the team with control of the ball, attempts to advance the ball down the field by running or passing the ball, while the opposing team aims to stop their advance and tries to take control of the ball.
